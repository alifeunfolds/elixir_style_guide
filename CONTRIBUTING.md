# Contributing to the Elixir Style Guide

First of all, thanks for wanting to contribute! :heart:

You can contribute in several ways:

* open up an issue if you find something plain old wrong in the style guide
  (e.g., typos or formatting);
* open up an issue if you find inconsistencies in the style guide. This way, we
  can discuss the better way to eliminate those inconsistencies;
* if you have any suggestions or opinions, open up an issue or (even better!) a
  pull request.

If you edit the `README.md` file, please stick to this set of
formatting/markup/style rules so that the style remains consistent:

* don't make lines longer than 80 characters (most editors have an auto-wrapping
  functionality, for example [emacs](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/LineWrap) or
  [vim](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Automatic_word_wrapping));
* leave **two newlines** before each first, second and third level header (`#`
  to `###`) and **one newline** before every other type of headers (`####` to
  `######`).

Install [markdownlint](https://github.com/mivok/markdownlint) to check your
changes, and run:

```sh
mdl --style 'markdown.rb' README.md
```

Check additional style guidelines by installing Elixir and running:

```sh
mix elixir_style_guide.check README.md
```
